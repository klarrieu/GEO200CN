## Question 1.1

The primary difference between the two maps used in OSU vs. rspatial is that the rspatial map used is much higher resolution. As a result, even when the same yardstick is used, the rspatial map results in a longer coastline length.

## Question 2.1

```{r}
# independent variable
ind <- c(87, 95, 72, 37, 44, 24,
         40, 55, 55, 38, 88, 34,
         41, 30, 26, 35, 38, 24,
         14, 56, 37, 34,  8, 18,
         49, 44, 51, 67, 17, 37,
         55, 25, 33, 32, 59, 54)
# dependent variable
dep <- c(72, 75, 85, 29, 58, 30,
         50, 60, 49, 46, 84, 23,
         21, 46, 22, 42, 45, 14,
         19, 36, 48, 23,  8, 29,
         38, 47, 52, 52, 22, 48,
         58, 40, 46, 38, 35, 55)


```
